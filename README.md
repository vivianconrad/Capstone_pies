## Source

Code was created with a [todo list tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning) that we will modify more, but I tried to modify the css a bunch and it crashed. So someone who is better at css will def do better

### other notes

we have active, complete but need to add the categories for learning, personal and work.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
